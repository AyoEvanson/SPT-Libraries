# QuickStart
## Intial Setup

This manual requires a basic understanding of the SPT-Library functions.
Beckhoff Kinematic Transformation package needs to be installed along with the Advanced Motion Package.

[Advanced Motion Package Download](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/tfxxxx-twincat-3-functions/tf5xxx-tc3-motion-control/tf5420.html)


!!! Note
	Kinematic transformation available up to L3. L4 which contains more than 4 Axis is available via your Beckhoff Sales contact upon request and Project.


## Step By Step setup
### 1. Add Kinematic to Project 

Add NC-Channel for Kinematic Transformation to your Project.

!!! Note 
	The following pictures are functioning as example, adjustment is needed if different Kinematic is needed.

Add desired Kinematic to the NC-Channel of your Project.

### 2. Add Kinematic to Project

Depending on Point (1) add the appropriate number of ACS and MCS Axis to your Motion Project.
Recommended is the organization in Folders for ACS and MCS.

ACS = Axis Coordinate System (Joint 1, Joint 2,..)

MCS = Machine Coordinate System (X,Y,Z,Rotation Axis 1,..)


### 3. Create Component of `FB_KinematicMotionAmpBase`

Create Component instanz in the desired EM or Machine of the SPT Framework.
Configure the Name of the Kinematic and the desired Degrees of Freedom. E.g. 3D-Delta Type 1 (P_3C) = `E_KinematicDOF.eKinematicDOF_3`

Add oid from the Kinematic object to the configruation:

**Congratulations!**
You can now Enable and Jog your Kinematic via the Template HMI locally on you PC.
